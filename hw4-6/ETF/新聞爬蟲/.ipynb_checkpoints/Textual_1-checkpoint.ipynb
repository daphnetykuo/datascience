A frustrated news journalist best known for venting his spleen in unguarded “off-camera” rants which have garnered him millions of fans worldwide, this satirical character’s second live show sees him attacking both sides of the political divide. From the Tories and Trump on the right to the permanently offended PC brigade on the left.Pie’s career is in the doldrums. He’s fed-up of being “stuck on street corners with a microphone like some sort of News hooker!” But he believes he is destined for greatness and is attempting to get his new TV show, The Jonathan Pie Political Roadshow, commissioned by the BBC by filming a ‘non-to-air” pilot. Pie attempts to host a night of serious political discussions about the effects of Tory cuts and Trump’s demented tweets but it soon descends into chaos when Pie inadvertently offends a member of the public.As his frustrations boil over we are treated to a public meltdown (and twitterstorm) unlike anything you’ve ever seen. As his career falls apart before his eyes, he betrays his leftie credentials and starts having a go at his own side: the “Loony Left” and their obsession with taking offence and their chronic inability to debate.Expect laughs and gasps in this show of biting satire that tears apart the world of politics and the media, from left to right and everything in between.

Donald Trump, Brexit, the War in Syria, the endless migrant crisis, random bomb attacks. And those who are supposed to be in power are paralysed - they have no idea what to do.This film is the epic story of how we got to this strange place. It explains not only why these chaotic events are happening - but also why we, and our politicians, cannot understand them.It shows that what has happened is that all of us in the West - not just the politicians and the journalists and the experts, but we ourselves - have retreated into a simplified, and often completely fake version of the world. But because it is all around us we accept it as normal.But there is another world outside.

He has given us some political slogans we still use today (Crossing the Rubicon), his name lives on in the month of July, and there is nothing new about Vladmir Putin's carefully cultivated military image, and no real novelty in Donald Trump's tweets and slogans.Mary Beard is on a mission to uncover the real Caesar, and to challenge public perception. She seeks the answers to some big questions. How did he become a one-man ruler of Rome? How did he use spin and PR on his way to the top? Why was he killed? And she asks some equally intriguing little questions. How did he conceal his bald patch? Did he really die, as William Shakespeare put it, with the words Et tu, Brute on his lips? Above all, Mary explores his surprising legacy right up to the present day. Like it or not, Caesar is still present in our everyday lives, our language, and our politics.

Romesh finds out if there is more to Haiti than the sensational headlines on the news.Romesh Ranganathan is a comedian and TV presenter whose idea of a nice trip away is two weeks in the Algarve. In this three-part series, he is travelling way beyond his comfort zone and the world of complimentary breakfast buffets to some of the most unlikely places on earth for a holiday. Hosted by locals and fully immersed in the local culture, Romesh gets an eye-opening, and at times heart-stopping, insider's guide to countries that are big on natural beauty, character and charm.In this first episode, Romesh gets an insider's guide to Haiti to find out if his preconceptions about the Caribbean island are right, or if there is more to the country than the sensational headlines he has seen on the news. Everything Romesh has ever heard about Haiti has been negative. They had a dictator who terrorised the island, a 2010 earthquake that crippled the country and then a devastating hurricane. That is all before President Trump called it something unmentionable. But are all the bad news reports fair? Does Haiti deserve its reputation? Haiti is in the middle of the Caribbean, surrounded by Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. It should be a paradise, so why doesn't anyone go there?To find out, Romesh Ranganathan, comedian and coward, is travelling across the Atlantic to spend a week in the country. This isn't his typical holiday destination - Romesh's idea of a perfect holiday is a week in Spain. He avoids 'culture' and he rarely leaves the comfort of the hotel swimming pool. In almost every conceivable way he is the wrong person to send, except one - he is honest. Landing in the Haitian capital Port au Prince, Romesh sets to work getting to grips with a country that - arguably more than any other - has suffered from a bad reputation. Guided by his host - Peabody award-winning journalist Jeremy Dupin - Rom throws himself into Haitian life. It is a chaotic journey that will take him from the iron market to vodou ceremonies, from cathedrals destroyed by the earthquake to the slums.So has the world got it wrong about Haiti?

Made by award-winning documentary maker Olly Lambert, One Day in Gaza examines, moment by moment, what happened on that fateful day.14 May 2018 started as a day of mass protest at Gaza’s border with Israel, and would end as one of the most deadly days in Gaza for a generation. For weeks, Palestinians had been protesting along the border fence, but tensions were running particularly high due to the opening of the new United States embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - the controversial step ordered by Donald Trump. As Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and other senior US officials gathered in Jerusalem to inaugurate the new embassy, tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered at sites along the Gaza border, barely 40 miles away. As the sun set that day, over 60 Palestinians were dead or dying, and over two thousand lay injured, many by live ammunition. Drawing on more than 120 hours of archive footage filmed on both sides of the border that day - including exclusive videos released by both Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that dominates Gaza, and the Israel Defense Forces, this film reveals the complex reality and human toll of the day, and asks who is to blame for the bloodshed. It also features exclusive interviews with senior commanders and intelligence officers from the Israel Defense Forces, as well as political leaders of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group, and civilians who were present on both sides of the border. What really happened that day? Israel said its troops only opened fire in self-defence or on people using the protests as cover for an armed infiltration, while Palestinians and human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force against unarmed civilians who posed no threat.
